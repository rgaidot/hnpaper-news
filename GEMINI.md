# Project Context: HNPaper News

## Project Overview
**HNPaper News** is a static website built with **Jekyll** that serves as an automated news aggregator/archive. It publishes daily summaries of news from [HNPaper](https://hnpaper-labs.gaidot.net). The site is designed to be hosted on **GitHub Pages** and uses the `jekyll-theme-hacker` theme. The primary language of the content is **French**.

## Key Directories and Files
*   **`_config.yml`**: The main configuration file for Jekyll. It defines the site title, theme, pagination settings, and plugins.
*   **`_posts/`**: Contains the individual news posts. Files follow the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-news.md`.
*   **`index.md`**: The entry point of the site, which loops through and displays recent posts.
*   **`.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`**: The GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages upon pushing to the `main` branch.
*   **`assets/css/style.scss`**: Custom SCSS styles, likely used to customize the default theme.

## Development & Usage

### Building and Running Locally
To run the site locally, you would typically use the standard Jekyll commands (assuming a Ruby environment with Bundler is set up):

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```
2.  **Serve the Site:**
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
    This will build the site and host it at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Creating New Posts
New posts are added to the `_posts/` directory.

*   **Filename Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-news.md` (e.g., `2026-01-27-1400-news.md`)
*   **Content Structure:**
    Each post uses YAML front matter followed by the content in Markdown.
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: "Actualités du 27/01/2026 à 14:00"
    date: 2026-01-27T14:00:00+01:00
    author: HNPaper Bot
    tags: [news]
    layout: post
    ---
    (Post content goes here...)
    ```

### Deployment
The site is deployed automatically via GitHub Actions.
*   **Trigger:** Pushing to the `main` branch.
*   **Workflow:** The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml` builds the Jekyll site and pushes the artifacts to the `gh-pages` environment.

## Conventions
*   **Language:** The content and UI text are in **French**.
*   **Theme:** The site uses `jekyll-theme-hacker`.
*   **Automation:** The posts appear to be generated by a bot (`HNPaper Bot`), suggesting an external process or script (possibly running elsewhere) commits these files to the repository.
