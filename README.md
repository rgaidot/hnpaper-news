    -   **Shortcut**: Press `Space` to Play/Pause.
-   **PWA Support**: Installable as a native app on mobile and desktop devices with offline caching capabilities.
-   **Share Section**: Click on the link icon next to any paragraph to copy a direct link to that specific section.
-   **Newspaper Design**: A clean, serif-focused aesthetic inspired by classic print media.

## 📄 Data Format

News items are stored in `src/content/news/` as Markdown files.
**Filename convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`

### Frontmatter Schema
Each file must begin with the following YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Actualités du 27/01/2026 à 14:00"
date: 2026-01-27T14:00:00+01:00
author: HNPaper Bot
tags: [news]
---
```

## 🛠️ Installation and Local Development

Prerequisites: Bun installed (https://bun.sh).

1.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server**

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

    The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

3.  **Build for production**

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

    The generated files will be in the `dist/` folder.

4.  **Preview the production build**

    ```bash
    bun run preview
    ```

## 📦 Deployment

Deployment is automated via **GitHub Actions**.
On every push to the `main` branch, the workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the site and deploys it to the GitHub Pages environment.
