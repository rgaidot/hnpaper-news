# HNPaper News

Automated news from [HNPaper](https://hnpaper-labs.gaidot.net) published as a Jekyll site.

## Features
- Daily posts generated automatically.
- Pagination (10 per page).
- French language support.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How it works
The site is built with the **jekyll‑theme‑hacker** theme. Posts are stored in `_posts` and are rendered using Jekyll’s default layout.

## Deployment
Push to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`, which builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
